        I would like to share a brief snippet about myself. I was born and
        raised in Dallas, Texas, under the care of my amazing single mother.
        After her departure from this world, I found solace in self-isolation,
        and it was during that time that I discovered the world of programming.
        Since then, coding has become a significant part of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when I'm not immersed in writing code, you can find me bustling
        and showing off my skills as a bartender at various venues. Flipping
        bottles and mixing drinks is not just a job for me, but a passion that
        allows me to engage with people in a different way.
